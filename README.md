Personal vision for various aspects of a programming language one needs to learn in order to
master it. I'm not imposing it to anybody and I'm open to discussion. I've written those
steps being influenced by colleagues and friends with a richer experience than mine.

Steps for learning and mastering a programming language:

1. Literals, language constructs, syntax structures (loops, conditionals, class/method
	declarations, primitives, literals), syntax pecularities, type-casting/coercing/conversion,
	operator precedence, scope gates, default return values of functions
2. Core functions, methods and/or classes (e.g. for operations with arrays, math operations, strings,
   file system, collections, date and time etc.)
3. Standard library (e.g. Standard Python Library, C standard library,
	Standard PHP library, jQuery, Ruby stdlib) -
    classes, methods and functions
4. Error and exception handling classes (in case of OOP), error/warning/notice messages
5. Compiler and toolchain (if it is a compiled language)
6. Theory about the inner workings of the language (e.g. VM, parser/lexer,
	interpreter, compiler "eco-system")
7. Become familiar with the language documentation in depth.
7. IDE(s)/Text editor(s) and their configuration
8. Code Conventions
9. Debugger(s) and debugging techniques
10. Security practices.
11. Build system, static code analysis and dependency management tools
12. Design patterns implementation (if the language supports OOP)
14. Reflections/metaprogramming/Introspection
15. Unit Testing practises and framework(s)
16. Profiler(s) and performance pecularities
17. Server-side setup (system administration part)

18. Create and maintain a project with a large codebase,
having in mind security, performance, maintainability
and user experience.
