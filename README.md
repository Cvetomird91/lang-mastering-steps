Pearsonal vision for various aspects of a programming language one needs to learn in order to
master a programming language. This is my opinion about the topic, I'm not imposing it to
anybody and I'm open to discussion.

Steps for learning and mastering a programming language:

1. Literals, language constructs, syntax structures (loops, conditionals, class/method
	declarations, primitives), syntax pecularities, type-casting/coercing/conversion,
	operator precedence, scope gates, default return values of functions
2. Core functions, methods and/or classes (e.g. for operations with arrays, math, strings,
   file system, date and time etc.)
3. Standard library (e.g. Standard Python Library, C standard library,
	Standard PHP library, jQuery, Ruby stdlib) -
    classes, methods and functions
4. Error and exception handling classes (in case of OOP), error/warning/notice messages
5. Compiler and toolchain (if it is a compiled language)
6. Theory about the inner workings of the language (e.g. VM, parser/lexer,
	interpreter, compiler "eco-system")
7. IDE(s)/Text editor(s) and their configuration
8. Code Conventions
9. Debugger(s) and debugging techniques
10. Profiler(s) and performance pecularities
11. Build system, static code analysis and dependency management tools
12. Design patterns implementation (in case of OOP)
14. Reflections/metaprogramming/Introspection
15. Unit Testing practises and framework(s)
16. Server-side setup (system administration part)
17. Security practices.

18. Create and maintain a project with a large codebase,
having in mind security, performance, maintainability
and user experience.
